# E-Commerce
This project is a full stack web application. It is created from two subprojects: Admin and Client. The aim of the project is to enable the user who wants to sell their products to their customers to customize the e-commerce page as they wish by only managing customized products and categories, without interfering with the e-commerce part, and to track, sell and invoice the products sold, as well as list which products are sold more and the most profitable products on the dashboard page. On the client side, an application has been designed where customers can shop, again with a responsive design, presented with a page layout set by the admin.
